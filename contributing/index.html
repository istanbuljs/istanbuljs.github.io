      Creating a Pull Request
    </div>

    <p>
      Have an idea for a cool new feature? want to contribute a bug fix? We'd love to
      have you contribute:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Look through the existing issues and see if your idea is something new. </li>
      <li> Create a <a href="https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues" target="_blank"> new issue </a>, or comment on an existing issue that you would like to help solve:
        <ul>
          <li> it's usually best to get some feedback before proceeding to write code.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li> fork the appropriate Istanbul repo, and clone it to your computer:
        <ul>
          <li> GitHub has <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/" target="_blank"> great documentation </a> regarding writing your first pull request. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li> make sure that you write unit-test for any code that you write for Istanbul:</li>
    </ul>

      Contributor Behavior
    </div>

    <p>
      Be kind to one another. We're striving to make Istanbul an inclusive environment that's great for first
      time open-source contributors.
    </p>
    <p>
      tldr; we value value constructive community interaction, over technical acumen.
