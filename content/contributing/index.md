title: Contributing to Istanbul
---

We would love to have you contribute to the Istanbul project, be it:

- creating a detailed bug report.
- adding a cool new feature.
- fixing bugs.
- helping us with our documentation or website.

No contribution is too small, and we love first time open-source contributors.

##  Reporting a Bug

To report a bug, simply open an issue on the appropriate GitHub repository
in the organization.

If you're not sure what component of Istanbul the issue might be occurring in,
<a href="https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues/new">open an issue on nyc</a> Istanbul's command
line client.

Please provide the following information when drafting a bug report:

- **Expected Behavior**: how should things be working?
- **Observed Behavior**: what did you observe happening instead?
- **Code**: provide a repository, or snippet of code, that reproduces the bug.
- **Environment Information**: provide the following information about your environment:
  - your operating system.
  - your Node.js version.
  - your npm version.
  - your project dependencies.

_Here's a handy script you can run:_

```bash
sh -c 'node --version; npm --version; npm ls' > output.txt
```

##  Creating a Pull Request

Have an idea for a cool new feature? want to contribute a bug fix? We'd love to
have you contribute:
- Look through the existing issues and see if your idea is something new.
- Create a <a href="https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues"> new issue </a>, or comment on an existing issue that you would like to help solve:
  - it's usually best to get some feedback before proceeding to write code.
- fork the appropriate Istanbul repo, and clone it to your computer:
  - GitHub has <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/"> great documentation </a> regarding writing your first pull request.
- make sure that you write unit-test for any code that you write for Istanbul:

## Contributor Behavior

Be kind to one another. We're striving to make Istanbul an inclusive environment that's great for first
time open-source contributors.

tldr; we value value constructive community interaction, over technical acumen.
